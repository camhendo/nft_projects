# EggNFT

Randomly generated, all on-chain, easter egg NFT! Minting is open and available until the day after April 16, 2022! Once the 16th hits, I will be turning off the contract forever. 

Send one to a friend, compare patterns, and more. Egg ownership will give utility in early access to my future projects (under development currently). 

Each egg is combination of patterns, colors, and designs that are compiled into one SVG file. No IPFS, and unlimited mints available. The only limiter is the time left to mint.

## Creating an Egg

As I don't have the exact knowledge to create a reactJS webapp as of this moment for letting you easily mint with one click. Here is how it workds. 

1. Go to the contract on [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x2eb0e66C9D3f38fbA4Ad883e81d48221C9740ff0) - if you're skeptical about the link here. This is the contract address: 0x2eb0e66C9D3f38fbA4Ad883e81d48221C9740ff0 (you can verify this is true via the opensea collection page)

2. Scroll down to the contract tab, and then select 'Write Contract' (or use this [link](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x2eb0e66C9D3f38fbA4Ad883e81d48221C9740ff0#writeContract)). 

3. Click "Connect to Web3" and sign the transaction with your respective walled (for most, this is MetaMask)

4. Click "Connect to Web3" again and when the words change to: "Connected - Web3 [address]" then you're ready to mint!

5. Head down to the 'mindEgg' transaction (number 3)

6. The minimum cost for an Egg is 12 MATIC. You'll need 12 MATIC in your wallet (plus about 0.5 MATIC for transaction fees) to pay facilitate this.

*If you need instruction on how to get MATIC tokens, DM me on twitter [@_camhendo](https://twitter.com/_camhendo)! I'm happy to help onboard anyone into Web3! :)*

7. Enter 12 in the box below mintEgg and click 'Write'. Wait for the transaction to appear with your wallet, approve and sign it. Then you're done!!!

Transactions take a minute or two to be recorded to the blockchain. So wait a few minutes before checking your wallet. After a few minutes, head to OpenSea and check your holdings (connect your wallet to OpenSea and then check your account). This is the easiest way to view your NFTs in my opinion.

Thanks so much for minting an EGG!!! Share it with me on twitter or DM me, I'm super happy you got yourself an NFT, and from me no less :).


### Reminder: minting is turned off forever on April 16, 2022!
